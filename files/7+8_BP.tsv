GO_SYMBIOTIC_PROCESS	980	A process carried out by gene products in an organism that enable the organism to engage in a symbiotic relationship, a more or less intimate association, with another organism. The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts. [GOC:cc, https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiont-definition-lesson-quiz.html]	11	0.0112	2.86E-9	4.33E-6

Transferase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 2. [EC:2.-.-.-, GOC:ai]	6	0.0059	5.69E-4	4.9E-2
GO_REGULATION_OF_CATABOLIC_PROCESS	1030	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate, or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of substances. [GOC:go_curators]	6	0.0058	5.93E-4	5.01E-2
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_PROTEASOMAL_UBIQUITIN_DEPENDENT_PROTEIN_CATABOLIC_PROCESS	35	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of the breakdown of a protein or peptide by hydrolysis of its peptide bonds, initiated by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, and mediated by the proteasome. [GOC:mah]	2	0.0571	5.95E-4	5.01E-2
GO_NEURON_MIGRATION	164	The characteristic movement of an immature neuron from germinal zones to specific positions where they will reside as they mature. [CL:0000540, GOC:go_curators]	3	0.0183	6.4E-4	5.33E-2
GO_TRNA_TRANSPORT	37	The directed movement of tRNA, transfer ribonucleic acid, into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore. [GOC:ai]	2	0.0541	6.65E-4	5.42E-2
GO_MITOTIC_CELL_CYCLE	1053	Progression through the phases of the mitotic cell cycle, the most common eukaryotic cell cycle, which canonically comprises four successive phases called G1, S, G2, and M and includes replication of the genome and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. In some variant cell cycles nuclear replication or nuclear division may not be followed by cell division, or G1 and G2 phases may be absent.

GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_TRANSFERASE_ACTIVITY	694	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transferase activity, the catalysis of the transfer of a group, e.g. a methyl group, glycosyl group, acyl group, phosphorus-containing, or other groups, from a donor compound to an acceptor. [GOC:ai]	5	0.0072	6.87E-4	5.53E-2

GO_CELL_JUNCTION_ORGANIZATION	713	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a cell junction. A cell junction is a specialized region of connection between two cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix. [GOC:dph, GOC:jl, GOC:mah]	5	0.0070	7.76E-4	5.89E-2
