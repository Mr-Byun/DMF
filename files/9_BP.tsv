GO_G_PROTEIN_COUPLED_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING_PATHWAY	1375	A series of molecular signals that proceeds with an activated receptor promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The GTP-bound activated alpha-G-protein then dissociates from the beta- and gamma-subunits to further transmit the signal within the cell. The pathway begins with receptor-ligand interaction, or for basal GPCR signaling the pathway begins with the receptor activating its G protein in the absence of an agonist, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.  The pathway can start from the plasma membrane, Golgi or nuclear membrane. [GOC:bf, GOC:mah, PMID:16902576, PMID:24568158, Wikipedia:G_protein-coupled_receptor]	3	0.0022	1.11E-2	9.62E-1
