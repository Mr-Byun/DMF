GO_CONDENSED_CHROMOSOME_CENTROMERIC_REGION	122	The region of a condensed chromosome that includes the centromere and associated proteins, including the kinetochore. In monocentric chromosomes, this region corresponds to a single area of the chromosome, whereas in holocentric chromosomes, it is evenly distributed along the chromosome. [GOC:elh, GOC:kmv]	2	0.0164	3.3E-3	3.67E-1
GO_MITOCHONDRIAL_MATRIX	473	The gel-like material, with considerable fine structure, that lies in the matrix space, or lumen, of a mitochondrion. It contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, in some organisms, the enzymes concerned with fatty acid oxidation. [GOC:as, ISBN:0198506732]	3	0.0063	4.3E-3	4.3E-1
GO_ADHERENS_JUNCTION	166	A cell-cell junction composed of the epithelial cadherin-catenin complex. The epithelial cadherins, or E-cadherins, of each interacting cell extend through the plasma membrane into the extracellular space and bind to each other. The E-cadherins bind to catenins on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, where the E-cadherin-catenin complex binds to cytoskeletal components and regulatory and signaling molecules. [GOC:aruk, GOC:bc, GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:17854762, PMID:20571587, PMID:21422226, PMID:28096264]	2	0.0120	6.01E-3	5.37E-1
GO_EXTRINSIC_COMPONENT_OF_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	172	The component of a plasma membrane consisting of gene products and protein complexes that are loosely bound to one of its surfaces, but not integrated into the hydrophobic region. [GOC:curators, GOC:dos]	2	0.0116	6.43E-3	5.37E-1
GO_NUCLEAR_OUTER_MEMBRANE_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM_MEMBRANE_NETWORK	1124	The continuous network of membranes encompassing the nuclear outer membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. [GOC:bf, GOC:jl, GOC:mah, GOC:mcc, GOC:pr, GOC:vw]	4	0.0036	7.37E-3	5.68E-1
GO_SUPRAMOLECULAR_COMPLEX	1311	A cellular component that consists of an indeterminate number of proteins or macromolecular complexes, organized into a regular, higher-order structure such as a polymer, sheet, network or a fiber. [GOC:dos]	4	0.0031	1.25E-2	8.93E-1
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM	1429	The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached). [ISBN:0198506732]	4	0.0028	1.67E-2	9.91E-1
GO_VACUOLE	802	A closed structure, found only in eukaryotic cells, that is completely surrounded by unit membrane and contains liquid material. Cells contain one or several vacuoles, that may have different functions from each other. Vacuoles have a diverse array of functions. They can act as a storage organelle for nutrients or waste products, as a degradative compartment, as a cost-effective way of increasing cell size, and as a homeostatic regulator controlling both turgor pressure and pH of the cytosol.
