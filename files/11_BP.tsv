The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts. [GOC:cc, https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiont-definition-lesson-quiz.html]	11	0.0112	1.37E-6	4.72E-4

GO_CELL_CYCLE_G2_M_PHASE_TRANSITION	273	The cell cycle process by which a cell in G2 phase commits to M phase. [GOC:jl, GOC:mtg_cell_cycle]	5	0.0183	1.36E-4	1.1E-2
GO_DNA_REPLICATION	273	The cellular metabolic process in which a cell duplicates one or more molecules of DNA. DNA replication begins when specific sequences, known as origins of replication, are recognized and bound by initiation proteins, and ends when the original DNA molecule has been completely duplicated and the copies topologically separated. The unit of replication usually corresponds to the genome of the cell, an organelle, or a virus. The template for replication can either be an existing DNA molecule or RNA.

GO_MITOTIC_NUCLEAR_ENVELOPE_REASSEMBLY	10	The cell cycle process that results in reformation of the nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division. [GOC:ai]	2	0.2000	1.42E-4	1.13E-2
GO_RUFFLE_ORGANIZATION	56	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a ruffle, a projection at the leading edge of a crawling cell. [GOC:mah, PMID:10036235]	3	0.0536	1.44E-4	1.14E-2
GO_RETINA_DEVELOPMENT_IN_CAMERA_TYPE_EYE	150	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the retina over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The retina is the innermost layer or coating at the back of the eyeball, which is sensitive to light and in which the optic nerve terminates.
