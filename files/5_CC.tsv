GO_SYNAPSE	1357	The junction between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron, a muscle fiber or a glial cell.

At the tip of the terminal bouton is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane. [GOC:aruk, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:24619342, PMID:29383328, PMID:31998110]	9	0.0066	1.19E-4	1.98E-2
