However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts. [GOC:cc, https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiont-definition-lesson-quiz.html]	13	0.0133	2.29E-7	9.11E-5

GO_RESPONSE_TO_ABIOTIC_STIMULUS	1237	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an abiotic (not derived from living organisms) stimulus. [GOC:hb]	11	0.0089	8.46E-5	7.28E-3
GO_VASCULATURE_DEVELOPMENT	826	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the vasculature over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The vasculature is an interconnected tubular multi-tissue structure that contains fluid that is actively transported around the organism. [GOC:dph, UBERON:0002409]	9	0.0109	8.6E-5	7.32E-3

GO_NUCLEAR_TRANSCRIBED_MRNA_CATABOLIC_PROCESS	210	The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of nuclear-transcribed mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. [GOC:krc]	5	0.0238	1.04E-4	8.27E-3
GO_APOPTOTIC_PROCESS	1994	A programmed cell death process which begins when a cell receives an internal (e.g. DNA damage) or external signal (e.g. an extracellular death ligand), and proceeds through a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway phase) which trigger an execution phase. The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died.

GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DEATH	1746	Any process that modulates the rate or frequency of cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death.

GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_SUBSTRATE_ADHESION	217	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell-substrate adhesion. Cell-substrate adhesion is the attachment of a cell to the underlying substrate via adhesion molecules. [GOC:dph, GOC:pf, GOC:tb]	5	0.0230	1.21E-4	9.22E-3
