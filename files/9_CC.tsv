GO_NEUROMUSCULAR_JUNCTION	76	The junction between the axon of a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. In response to the arrival of action potentials, the presynaptic button releases molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber, leading to a change in post-synaptic potential. [GOC:nln]	2	0.0263	3.18E-4	4.2E-2

GO_BRUSH_BORDER	106	The dense covering of microvilli on the apical surface of a epithelial cells in tissues such as the intestine, kidney, and choroid plexus; the microvilli aid absorption by increasing the surface area of the cell. [GOC:sl, ISBN:0815316194]	2	0.0189	6.18E-4	6.18E-2
GO_SYNAPSE	1357	The junction between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron, a muscle fiber or a glial cell. As the axon approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic terminal bouton, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the terminal bouton is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane. [GOC:aruk, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:24619342, PMID:29383328, PMID:31998110]	4	0.0029	9.98E-4	8.95E-2
