GO_SM_LIKE_PROTEIN_FAMILY_COMPLEX	112	A protein complex containing members of the Like-Sm family of proteins, which includes both the Sm proteins and the Lsm proteins, and which generally form hexameric or heptameric ring structures which bind to RNA. While some of these ring complexes may form independently of RNA, many only form in association with their target RNA. In addition to Lsm-family proteins, many of these complexes contain additional protein members. Members of this family of complexes include the snRNPs which comprise the majority of the spliceosome. Others are involved in the 5' to 3' degradation pathways of mRNAs in the cytoplasm and of unspliced transcripts in the nucleus, as well as other diverse roles.

GO_ACTIN_FILAMENT	117	A filamentous structure formed of a two-stranded helical polymer of the protein actin and associated proteins. Actin filaments are a major component of the contractile apparatus of skeletal muscle and the microfilaments of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. The filaments, comprising polymerized globular actin molecules, appear as flexible structures with a diameter of 5-9 nm. They are organized into a variety of linear bundles, two-dimensional networks, and three dimensional gels. In the cytoskeleton they are most highly concentrated in the cortex of the cell just beneath the plasma membrane. [GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:10666339]	2	0.0171	2.3E-2	2.65E-1
