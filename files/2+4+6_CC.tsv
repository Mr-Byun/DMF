The filaments, comprising polymerized globular actin molecules, appear as flexible structures with a diameter of 5-9 nm. They are organized into a variety of linear bundles, two-dimensional networks, and three dimensional gels. In the cytoskeleton they are most highly concentrated in the cortex of the cell just beneath the plasma membrane. [GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:10666339]	2	0.0171	1.7E-2	1.95E-1
GO_CLATHRIN_COATED_VESICLE_MEMBRANE	118	The lipid bilayer surrounding a clathrin-coated vesicle. [GOC:mah]	2	0.0169	1.73E-2	1.95E-1
GO_CENTROSOME	583	A structure comprised of a core structure (in most organisms, a pair of centrioles) and peripheral material from which a microtubule-based structure, such as a spindle apparatus, is organized. Centrosomes occur close to the nucleus during interphase in many eukaryotic cells, though in animal cells it changes continually during the cell-division cycle.
