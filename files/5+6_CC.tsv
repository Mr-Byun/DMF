In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane. [GOC:aruk, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:24619342, PMID:29383328, PMID:31998110]	17	0.0125	1.81E-7	2.59E-5

GO_CELL_BODY	592	The portion of a cell bearing surface projections such as axons, dendrites, cilia, or flagella that includes the nucleus, but excludes all cell projections. [GOC:go_curators]	6	0.0101	5.96E-3	6.77E-2
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM	1429	The irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. The ER takes two forms, rough (or granular), with ribosomes adhering to the outer surface, and smooth (with no ribosomes attached). [ISBN:0198506732]	10	0.0070	6.03E-3	6.78E-2
GO_SARCOLEMMA	135	The outer membrane of a muscle cell, consisting of the plasma membrane, a covering basement membrane (about 100 nm thick and sometimes common to more than one fiber), and the associated loose network of collagen fibers. [ISBN:0198506732]	3	0.0222	6.21E-3	6.9E-2
GO_KINETOCHORE	137	A multisubunit complex that is located at the centromeric region of DNA and provides an attachment point for the spindle microtubules. [GOC:elh]	3	0.0219	6.46E-3	7.11E-2
GO_CORNIFIED_ENVELOPE	45	A type of plasma membrane that has been modified through addition of distinct intracellular and extracellular components, including ceramide, found in cornifying epithelial cells (corneocytes). [GOC:add, PMID:11112355, PMID:11590230, PMID:15803139]	2	0.0444	6.84E-3	7.31E-2
GO_I_BAND	140	A region of a sarcomere that appears as a light band on each side of the Z disc, comprising a region of the sarcomere where thin (actin) filaments are not overlapped by thick (myosin) filaments; contains actin, troponin, and tropomyosin; each sarcomere includes half of an I band at each end. [ISBN:0321204131]	3	0.0214	6.86E-3	7.31E-2
GO_PHAGOCYTIC_VESICLE	140	A membrane-bounded intracellular vesicle that arises from the ingestion of particulate material by phagocytosis. [GOC:go_curators, ISBN:0198506732]	3	0.0214	6.86E-3	7.31E-2
GO_APICAL_PART_OF_CELL	433	The region of a polarized cell that forms a tip or is distal to a base. For example, in a polarized epithelial cell, the apical region has an exposed surface and lies opposite to the basal lamina that separates the epithelium from other tissue. [GOC:mah, ISBN:0815316194]	5	0.0115	6.98E-3	7.35E-2
GO_CLATHRIN_COAT	46	A membrane coat found on coated pits and some coated vesicles; consists of polymerized clathrin triskelions, each comprising three clathrin heavy chains and three clathrin light chains, linked to the membrane via one of the AP adaptor complexes.

GO_BASAL_PLASMA_MEMBRANE	51	The region of the plasma membrane located at the basal end of the cell. Often used in reference to animal polarized epithelial membranes, where the basal membrane is the part attached to the extracellular matrix, or in plant cells, where the basal membrane is defined with respect to the zygotic axis. [GOC:go_curators]	2	0.0392	8.72E-3	8.82E-2
