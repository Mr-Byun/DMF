GO_SYMBIOTIC_PROCESS	980	A process carried out by gene products in an organism that enable the organism to engage in a symbiotic relationship, a more or less intimate association, with another organism. The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts. [GOC:cc, https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiont-definition-lesson-quiz.html]	5	0.0051	5.33E-4	1.3E-1

GO_REGULATION_OF_CELL_CYCLE_PHASE_TRANSITION	486	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell cycle phase transition. [GOC:mtg_cell_cycle, GOC:TermGenie, PMID:22841721]	3	0.0062	4.64E-3	3.99E-1
GO_RESPONSE_TO_HYDROGEN_PEROXIDE	146	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stimulus. [GOC:jl]	2	0.0137	4.68E-3	3.99E-1
GO_REGULATION_OF_PROTEIN_LOCALIZATION	994	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of any process in which a protein is transported to, or maintained in, a specific location. [GOC:dph, GOC:mah, GOC:tb]	4	0.0040	4.8E-3	4.04E-1

GO_REGULATION_OF_MRNA_PROCESSING	152	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of mRNA processing, those processes involved in the conversion of a primary mRNA transcript into a mature mRNA prior to its translation into polypeptide. [GOC:ai]	2	0.0132	5.06E-3	4.17E-1
GO_NEGATIVE_REGULATION_OF_CELL_DEATH	1034	Any process that decreases the rate or frequency of cell death. Cell death is the specific activation or halting of processes within a cell so that its vital functions markedly cease, rather than simply deteriorating gradually over time, which culminates in cell death. [GOC:BHF, GOC:dph, GOC:tb]	4	0.0039	5.51E-3	4.49E-1
GO_RESPONSE_TO_CORTICOSTEROID	164	Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a corticosteroid hormone stimulus. A corticosteroid is a steroid hormone that is produced in the adrenal cortex. Corticosteroids are involved in a wide range of physiologic systems such as stress response, immune response and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels, and behavior. They include glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. [GOC:mah, PMID:11027914]	2	0.0122	5.87E-3	4.73E-1
GO_GENERATION_OF_PRECURSOR_METABOLITES_AND_ENERGY	534	The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of precursor metabolites, substances from which energy is derived, and any process involved in the liberation of energy from these substances. [GOC:jl]	3	0.0056	6.02E-3	4.8E-1
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_MITOTIC_CELL_CYCLE	168	Any process that activates or increases the rate or extent of progression through the mitotic cell cycle. [GOC:dph, GOC:go_curators, GOC:tb]	2	0.0119	6.15E-3	4.85E-1
GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_STRESS_ACTIVATED_PROTEIN_KINASE_SIGNALING_CASCADE	172	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of signaling via the stress-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. [GOC:mah]	2	0.0116	6.43E-3	4.99E-1
GO_FATTY_ACID_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS	173	The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of a fatty acid, any of the aliphatic monocarboxylic acids that can be liberated by hydrolysis from naturally occurring fats and oils. Fatty acids are predominantly straight-chain acids of 4 to 24 carbon atoms, which may be saturated or unsaturated; branched fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acids also occur, and very long chain acids of over 30 carbons are found in waxes.
